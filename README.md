# kattis_exercises

This repository is used by me to store various attempts to solve exercises for Kattis (https://open.kattis.com/).

It it possible several different languages will be used so on the top level the languages appear. And directly under
each language there is directories for each attempted solution.

Main idea with this repository is to share code between different platforms, both at work and at home.
